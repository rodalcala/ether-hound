# Front-end coding challenge for Aragon One



## Introduction

Single page application that allows the user to explore Ethereum's latest blocks.
It displays some detailed information about a specific transaction, which is by default the first transaction moving Ether.

It also displays some facts about the dataset under analysis.



## Getting started

Through the command line get to the enclosing folder for the project and install all the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Once that's finished, you can go ahead and start the development server locally with:

```
npm start
```

After that you can go to http://localhost:3000/ to have a look at the gnomes!

If you'd like to run the test suite, from the same folder just run:

```
npm test
```
